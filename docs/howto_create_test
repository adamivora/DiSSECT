1. Write x.py in the directory curve_analyzer/tests/x/ (don't forget __init__.py)
2. Add test x parameters into global params file (it's in the tests directory)
3. Create curve_analyzer/tests/x/x.params (or run gen_params.py in the tests directory, warning: all of the params file will be set to default)
4. Compute the result of x_curve_function on your chosen parameters for curves from curve_analyzer/tests/example_curves.py (do it in other way than using x_curve_function)
5. Run curve_analyzer/tests/gen_unittest.py -n x (You will be asked for the computed values)
6. The files x_structure.json, unit_tests/test_x.py were created, you can now modify the unit test for your needs

When updating a test, remember to regenerate the structure file and params file if needed.

Note that x_curve_function has to return a dict, and its values cannot be tuples (only single elements or lists (whose elements follow the same restrictions)).
